Kids Quest
==========
=======
Kid's Quest is a game which takes everyday chores and behavioral expectations out of the monotonous and into the exciting. It incorporates children's daily lives into a fun and interactive game with measurable feedback, rewards, and lessons.

Quests
------
The game consists mostly of 'quests' in which one or more of the players must complete a task in order to secure a reward. Quests are the interactive element of the game. They can be simple or complex, take less than a few minutes to complete or continue over the entire course of the game. Some quests are one time only and some are reoccurring. Some quests are on their own and some are part of a series. Each quest in a series must be completed before the next quest in the series is accessible.
